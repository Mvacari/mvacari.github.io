<p style="color:yellow;">Greetings everyone!</p>


<p>I'm Mihaela, and this space will be dedicated to various topics (<em>still figuring out the specifics</em>). But before we delve into that, let me introduce myself:</p>

I am one of the very few Moldovans out here in Berlin (and in the world, haha), educated in Romania, and enriched by experiences living across Romania, Spain, Poland, and Germany and traveling a big, yet very small, part of this world. Beside following the sun, I thrive on learning and achieving; the more proficient I become in something, the greater my desire for improvement.

<p>On the professional front, I have 5+ years of experience excelling in different settings- startups, corporations, embassies and off-the-street shops. My knack for fostering client relationships <del>and consistently surpassing targets</del> fuels my accomplishments.</p>

<strong>So, why this page?</strong> I embarked on this journey to grasp website creation basics, get an intro into HTML, CSS, and <i>master</i> GitHub.

<p><strong>What's in it for you?</strong> <br> I aim to share my knowledge with the world, hoping it resonates with at least one of the six humans who stumble upon this corner of the internet :) .</p>
